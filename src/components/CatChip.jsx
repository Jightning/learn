/* A block's principal tag, worn where the block sits.
 *
 * The chip is text first, because colour never carries meaning on its own
 * (T26) and because the reader has to be able to say the category's name to
 * look for it again. The monogram beside it is the recognisable part: it is
 * the same two or three characters everywhere that category appears, so a
 * scan down a section reads as a pattern rather than as a column of prose.
 *
 * No per-category hue. The palette is one angle per course, swept for contrast
 * in three colour modes across every view; a hue per category would multiply
 * that sweep to decorate something the text already says. Position and the
 * monogram do the keying instead, and both survive a colourblind reader, a
 * greyscale print and a dark theme without anything being re-measured.
 *
 * Chips do not render at `full` depth. Signalling is a contrast effect and it
 * degrades with density (T13) — a chip on every block during a reading pass is
 * wallpaper. Categorisation is a review-time device, so it appears exactly
 * where review happens.
