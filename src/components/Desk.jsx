 * What it replaces was an inventory — six counts, two of them saying the same
 * thing, all six zero on the day a reader arrives — above three equal ghost
 * buttons, none of which was "begin". The section list, the only thing a new
 * reader actually wants, was the quietest element on the page and started
 * 1,400px down a phone.
 *
 * `next.js` decides what leads and why; this only draws it. The secondary
 * items are drawn too, so the ranking stays a suggestion rather than a gate.
