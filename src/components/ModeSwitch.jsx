 * This replaces two segmented controls that sat in the content flow, above the
 * first paragraph of every section. It is one control because the reader has
 * one intent; the two axes underneath it are still there, still bound to their
 * keys, and reachable from the sidebar for anyone who wants them.
 *
 * When the axes have been moved to a pair that is not a preset, the switch says
 * so, with a dot against the mode it is nearest to, rather than showing that
 * intent as though it were exact. The alternative is a control that lies about
 * the state of the page the reader is looking at.
