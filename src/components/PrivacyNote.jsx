/* The one place the site says what leaves the device.
 *
 * It belongs here, next to the reader's own numbers, rather than beside the
 * backup settings — the question "what happens to my data" is asked while
 * looking at the data, not while configuring anything. It states the truth for
 * *this* device, and for a reader who has set nothing up that truth is the
 * short one: nothing leaves at all, ever, because there is nothing to leave to.
 *
 * The connected case has to be exact rather than reassuring. Something does
 * leave — that is the point of a backup — and what protects it is that it is
 * sealed before it goes, not that it is trusted after it arrives.

      This device backs up to your own account once a day. Your answer log, your
      courses, your notes and saved markers, and the settings that belong to the
      shelf — a course's colour, card order and dismissed bundled courses — are
      encrypted in this browser first, with a key derived from your secret, so
      they can be stored there but not read there. What the backup can see is
      the shape of it: which device wrote a row, when, and how big it was.
      Schedules are recomputed from the log rather than sent.
