/* The learner's notes on one block, in two pieces that share one state.
 *
 * WHERE THEY LIVE. Written notes are a card in the margin channel, stacked
 * under the reference cards beside them — same `.mnote` component, its own
 * accent. Under rather than over because a reference card is required to be
 * level with the mention it annotates [T12] and a note is not, so the note is
 * what yields when the two want the same row. Below the margin breakpoint the
 * channel wraps under the block and the notes come with it, which is why this
 * needs no second layout for a phone.
 *
 * WHERE THEY START. The block's own bottom edge carries a grip at the opacity
 * of page texture; pulling it down opens a new note. A press opens one too,
 * because a grip is also a button and a keyboard has no drag. The grip stays
 * put once a block has notes, since adding a second one is the same act as
 * adding the first.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the context menu. Right-click, long-press, selection,
 * Copy and Look Up stay the platform's.
