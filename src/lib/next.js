/* ============================================================================
 * src/lib/next.js — what this reader should do next, and why
 *
 * The course's front page used to be an inventory. It opened on "0/166 types
 * cleared · 0/32 concepts durable · 0 due today", then "0 mastered · 166 not
 * yet seen · 0 overconfident" — six numbers, two of which say the same thing,
 * none of which is an action, and every one of them zero on the day a reader
 * first arrives. The first thing the site said to a new reader was how much
 * they did not know, three different ways.
 *
 * What it could not say was the one thing a reader actually opens a course to
 * find out. Both loops already know their own half of the answer: `queue.js`
 * knows which concepts are due, `state.js` knows which question types are
 * uncleared, `place.js` knows which subsection reading stopped in. Nothing
 * arbitrated between them, so the reader did.
 *
 * This module is that arbitration and nothing else — a fold over state that
 * already exists into one ranked list. It is pure, it takes `now` as an
 * argument like the scheduler does, and it touches no DOM, so the ordering can
 * be tested without a browser (`tools/test-next.mjs`).
 *
 * ## Why this order
 *
 * Reviews decay and nothing else on the site does. A concept that came due
 * yesterday is losing the interval it earned, which is the one cost here that
 * grows while the reader does something else — so it leads, but only once
 * enough of them have collected to be worth a detour (DUE_FLOOR). Below that
 * they wait, because interrupting a reading session to answer two cards
 * teaches the reader that the site will nag.
 *
 * Everything after that is ordered by how much context the reader still holds:
 * finishing the subsection they were reading is cheaper than starting a new
 * one, and answering the questions on a subsection they just read is cheaper
 * than either. The last entry is the only one that is not work the reader has
 * already begun.
 *
 * ## What it will not do
 *
 * It never invents urgency. No streak, no daily goal, no count that exists to
 * be driven to zero — the meta-analytic result on badges and points is that
 * they raise extrinsic motivation and can undermine autonomy, which is poison
 * for a site whose whole premise is calibrated self-knowledge. Every item here
 * names a real piece of state and disappears when that state is cleared.
 *
 * It also never returns nothing. An empty queue is the moment a reader decides
 * whether to come back, and "Nothing due." with no way forward is the worst
 * answer available; when there is genuinely no outstanding work the last
 * branch offers the next unread section, and past the end of the course, free
 * practice.
