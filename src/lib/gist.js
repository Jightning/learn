/* What one block looks like at one depth.
 *
 * Two authored fields decide it, and a block declares at most one of them. The
 * field name *is* the declaration — there is no mode flag, for the same reason
 * an absent `tier:` is the declaration of spine: a second field recording a
 * choice the first already made is a second record to drift.
 *
 *   core:   the block's own opening claim, stored apart from its development.
 *           Renders in `full` AND `notes`. `h:` holds only what develops it,
 *           so nothing is written twice and M1 is satisfied outright.
 *
 *   gist:   a summary *about* the block. Renders in `notes` ONLY; `h:` is
 *           whole and untouched. This is a second copy, deliberately, and it
 *           exists for blocks whose prose must withhold its claim on first
 *           read — a `trap` works because you believed otherwise thirty words
 *           ago, and hoisting the correction defuses it. Notes depth showing
 *           it is not a loss: order matters on a first read, and a first read
 *           is `full`.
 *
 * Mnemonic: core is part of the block; gist is about the block.
 *
 * Everything else falls out of the registry, so a course's own blocks.js can
 * declare how its renderer behaves at depth without touching this file.

/*
 * What `notes` shows for a block whose author never wrote a claim.
 *
 * The architecture argues against extraction, and the argument is right about
 * what it measured. What it did not price is what the reader gets when the
 * guess is declined: `present()` fell through to the block's *name*, so on a
 * course with no claims every prose row in Review reads "Slope field …". Both
 * real courses sit at 100% unclaimed, so Review and Index rendered the same
 * page — which is exactly what a reader looking at them reported.
 *
 * The choice was therefore never "authored claim or derived claim". It was
 * "derived claim or no claim".
 *
 * And the measured failure rate turns out to be a property of the rule that was
 * measured rather than of extraction. That rule is `pretrain.js`'s, and it
 * terminates a sentence on `[.;:]` — so it cuts at the colon introducing a
 * list and returns the fragment before it, which is most of the 33% it was
 * charged with. Terminating on `[.!?]` alone and rejecting what is left over
 * yields a usable claim for **93% of ma26600's 182 unclaimed prose blocks**
 * and 82% of demo's 22 (`tools/measure-claims.mjs`). At six words the gate
 * admits "Order is the highest derivative present." — a real claim the
 * eight-word threshold rejected.
 *
 * The gate is what keeps the guess honest. A sentence ending on a colon or a
 * semicolon was leading into something that is not here; one under six words is
 * a fragment; one over 200 characters is the paragraph rather than its claim.
 * Any of those and the row falls back to the name, which is where it already
 * was — so this strictly adds and can never take a row backwards.
 *
 * `demo`, at 0% unclaimed, is what the authored version looks like, and nothing
 * here touches it: this runs only where the author wrote nothing. An authored
 * `core:` remains better than a derived claim and `audit-content.mjs` still
 * counts what is missing.
 *
 * Nothing is marked as derived on the row. The reader's question is "what does
 * this block say", and a badge on two thirds of the rows is the texture T44
 * names — the author's question is a different one and `audit-content.mjs`
 * already answers it with the unclaimed fraction.

 * flattening rendered KaTeX to text turns `y = Ce^{x^2}` into "y=Cex2", which
 * is not the same claim and is worse than no claim at all.
 *
 * The scan therefore runs over the source and has two places it must not stop:
