/* Categories and tags — the one grouping the site did not have.
 *
 * Everything the engine could group by was positional (a section), argumentative
 * (a tier) or referential (a concept mention). None of those is *membership*:
 * nothing could say "these six things are all X, and X is not Y". That is the
 * relation the middle stage of learning runs on, and it is the one a reader
 * still holds after they have forgotten which subsection something sat in —
 * which is exactly when position fails as an index.
 *
 *   cat:   one per block or concept, optional, and it must be declared.
 *          The *principal* tag: what kind of thing this is.
 *   tags:  many, optional, free-form. What else it would be found under.
 *
 * They are two fields because they serve two stages. A category answers "what
 * kind is this, and what is it not" — it carries a boundary and siblings, and
 * it is what a category page compares. Tags answer "where else would I look for
 * this", which is discovery, and wants no boundary at all.
 *
 * Drill items are not tagged. They already name their concept (M27), so a
 * drill's category is its concept's — derived, never authored, so there is no
 * third record to drift. Quiz items are likewise untouched: `type` is already
 * their identity (M9) and a second one would compete with it.
 *
 * Why a category page puts its members side by side: comparing cases beats
 * meeting them one at a time (d = 0.50; Alfieri, Nokes-Malach & Schunn 2013,
 * Educational Psychologist), and comparing against a declared sibling is what
 * makes the boundary visible rather than merely asserted. The same evidence is
 * why `siblings:` is required rather than nice to have — the contrast is the
 * mechanism, not the decoration.
