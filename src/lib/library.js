/* ============================================================================
 * src/lib/library.js — the one way any component reaches a course
 *
 * A course is a map of file path to text, fetched once and parsed in the
 * browser. Built-in courses ship as `courses/<id>.json` beside the app;
 * imported ones live in IndexedDB. Neither is compiled, so the bytes a model
 * writes are the bytes the app runs.
 *
 * `INDEX` is the part that is never lazy: the library card, the accent, and
 * the drill keys and retention target. lib/queue.js decides what is due from
 * drill *keys* alone, never the items, so the cross-course due badge is right
 * on first paint without fetching a single course.
 * ==========================================================================*/

 * introductory guide, and a guide you have read should not sit on the shelf
 * forever. Dismissing it hides the card and nothing else: the entry stays in
 * INDEX, so a link to it still opens and an import cannot silently collide
 * with its id or its code. It is per device, like everything else the browser
 * holds about the reader.
