/* ============================================================================
 * tools/lib/harness.mjs — put the built app in front of a browser
 *
 * Two things every browser-driving tool now needs, and neither is obvious.
 *
 * Courses are fetched at runtime, so the page needs an origin: `file://` cannot
 * fetch. And only the courses in `PUBLIC` reach dist/, so the private ones —
 * which is every other one — arrive the way a reader's own courses do, through
 * the import control. Sweeping only the public course would leave every other
 * palette and every other course's routes ungated.
