-- Two tables and a chunk table. `seq` is the cursor every device pages by: a
-- server-assigned counter rather than a timestamp, because two devices have
-- two clocks and a fast one would advance the other's cursor past rows it had
-- never seen. Row bodies are ciphertext (`enc`); the columns beside them are
-- what the server needs to dedupe, order and filter, and nothing more.

  seq    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

-- One row per course the account holds. `deleted_at` is a tombstone rather
-- than a delete: removing a course on one device has to reach the others, and
-- a row that simply vanished would be indistinguishable from one they had
-- never seen. The body stays until the tombstone is purged, which is what
-- makes "recently deleted" a restore rather than a promise.

-- The handful of settings that belong to the shelf rather than to a device:
-- a course's colour, the order of the cards, which bundled ones are dismissed.
-- One row per key, because a single settings blob would let a device that has
-- not looked in a week overwrite every key with what it remembers. `ts` is the
-- client's stamp and the only tiebreak: the later write wins, per key. The
-- value is ciphertext like everything else; the key name is not, exactly as a
-- course id is not.
