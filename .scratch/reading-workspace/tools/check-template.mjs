/* The probe is a whole course sitting in courses/, and the run that plants it
 * spends over ten minutes inside test-ui. If it dies without unwinding, the
 * scaffold is stranded — and a stranded probe is not inert, it silently joins
 * the next build as a ninth subject. One was found in the tree this way.
 *
 * Cleaning up on the way out cannot cover it. Ctrl-C at a terminal signals the
 * whole process group, so the child dies, execFileSync throws, and the finally
 * below already handles that. Anything that signals only this process is the
 * case that strands, and a handler cannot help there either: execFileSync
 * blocks the event loop, so a handler registered here would not run until the
 * child it is waiting on had finished anyway. SIGKILL runs nothing at all.
 *
 * So the guard runs on the way *in*, where nothing can prevent it. It matches
 * on the scaffold's own title and not the name prefix alone, so no real course
 * can be caught by it.
 *
 * `packed/` is swept for the same reason. A `pack.mjs --private` run while a
 * probe was planted bundles it like any other private course, and every gate
 * that calls installPacked() then installs it as a real subject — three had
 * accumulated there, showing up as three "Cloneability Probe" cards in the
 * library the suite tests against. The scaffold leaks into two places, so both
 * are cleaned.
