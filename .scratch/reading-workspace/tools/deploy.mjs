 * tools/deploy.mjs — build, publish, prune, and check
 *
 *   node tools/deploy.mjs            # keep the 2 newest deployments
 *   KEEP=1 node tools/deploy.mjs     # keep only the one just published
 *
 * Three things happen after the upload, and each exists because forgetting it
 * fails silently.
 *
 * **Prune.** Cloudflare never expires a deployment. Every one keeps its own
 * permanent `<hash>.<project>.pages.dev` address and goes on serving whatever
 * was in it, forever. Since a course is private by *absence* from the build,
 * an old deployment is a standing copy of everything that was public when it
 * was made. Keeping a couple for rollback is reasonable; keeping all of them
 * means the oldest mistake is the one still online.
 *
 * **Verify.** The production alias is checked for a course that should not be
 * there. This catches a stale `dist/` — uploading a folder built before a
 * course was made private looks exactly like a successful deploy, and the only
 * symptom is material being readable by anyone.
 *
 * The production URL never changes. Each deployment gets an immutable hash
 * address, and `<project>.pages.dev` is an alias that always points at the
 * newest one.
