/* Reading depth: how much of each block is on the page.
 *
 * Depth is not tier. Tier asks *which blocks belong to the argument* and
 * removes the ones that do not; depth asks *how much of each block* and closes
 * the rest in place. They are orthogonal, and neither can be fixed toward the
 * other — which is what a course whose blocks are 99% spine proves: filtering
 * by tier cannot produce an overview, because there is nothing to filter out.
 *
 *   full    the block entire. What has always shipped.
 *   notes   the block's claim, its development closed. ~a fifth of the prose.
 *   index   the block's name alone. Its claim closed too.
 *
 * Every depth expands per block, in place, at any time, so no depth is ever a
 * subset of the course: it is the same course at a different resolution.
 *
 * The evidence is specific about what this buys and what it does not. A
 * provided outline of a text raises memory (g = 0.61) and does *not* reliably
 * raise comprehension (g = 0.34, n.s.; Ponce, Mayer & Méndez 2023, Educational
 * Research Review). So `notes` and `index` are review and lookup surfaces, and
 * `full` remains what a first read means — which is why `full` is the default
 * and nothing nudges a reader off it.
