/* ============================================================================
 * src/lib/store.js — durable local storage, mirrored in memory
 *
 * localStorage was the wrong home for this and mobile is where it shows.
 * Web Storage caps at 10 MiB; the outcome log alone reaches ~4MB at CAP, and
 * every writer swallowed its own failure:
 *
 *     try { localStorage.setItem(KEY, JSON.stringify(rows)); } catch {}
 *
 * On a phone that is silent data loss — progress stops persisting with no
 * error and no symptom. Worse, the log re-serialised megabytes on every single
 * answer.
 *
 * IndexedDB fixes the quota. Two decisions make it fit the existing code:
 *
 *   1. **Memory is the read model.** Everything is loaded once at boot, so
 *      reads stay synchronous and no call site becomes async. Writes go to
 *      memory immediately and reach disk on a debounce.
 *   2. **The log gets its own store**, one record per row, so appending costs
 *      one small put rather than a rewrite of the whole array.
 *
 * Failures are no longer swallowed. `onError` reports them once so the app can
 * say so, because a study tool that quietly forgets is worse than one that
 * admits it cannot save.
