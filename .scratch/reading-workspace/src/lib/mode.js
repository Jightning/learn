/* ============================================================================
 * src/lib/mode.js — three named intents over two axes
 *
 * Lane and depth are orthogonal and both are load-bearing: the lane decides
 * which blocks are in the argument, the depth decides how much of each one is
 * open, and a course whose blocks are 99% spine proves neither can stand in for
 * the other. That reasoning is right and nothing here changes it.
 *
 * What was wrong was where the reader met it. Both selectors sat between a
 * section's blurb and its first word — nine combinations, named after what the
 * engine filters rather than after what the reader is doing, unexplained, on
 * every section. A reader arriving to learn about Laplace transforms was asked
 * two taxonomy questions first.
 *
 * So the axes keep working and a preset layer sits over them. Three intents,
 * named for the reading they support rather than for the mechanism:
 *
 *   Study    the first pass, everything open, worked instances included
 *   Review   claims and structure, development closed: the week before an exam
 *   Names    the lookup surface, entries and nothing under them
 *
 * The third was called "Index" and is not any more. The course now has an
 * *index*, a page of every idea and kind it declares, and one word naming both
 * a page you navigate to and a resolution the page you are on is drawn at is
 * one word too few. "Names" is also what the depth axis underneath it and the
 * Explore facet beside it already called this setting, so the rename makes
 * three surfaces agree rather than making a fourth name up.
 *
 * It is not "Find" either: the site already has a Find, it is bound to `/`, and
 * it answers a different question. A mode is a resolution the whole section is
 * drawn at; search takes you somewhere.
 *
 * Nothing is removed. Every intent is a (lane, depth) pair the reader could
 * already have set by hand, `1` `2` `3` and `d` still move the axes directly,
 * and a pair matching no preset is reported as such rather than mislabelled —
 * `modeOf` returns null and the switch shows the nearest intent as edited. A
 * control that silently claims you are in Study while you are reading something
 * else is worse than no control.
 *
 * Study is `apply` × `full` because that is what the two axes already default
 * to, and because the evidence is specific that a provided outline carries
 * memory but not comprehension (g = 0.34, n.s.) — so nothing here nudges a
 * first read off the full text.
