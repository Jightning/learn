/* What the browser's own assistant is told about the page.
 *
 * "Ask Google about this page" cannot be embedded, scoped or blocked. What can
 * be decided is what is in the document when it looks, so this builds one
 * machine-readable record of the current view: the course, where the view sits
 * in it, and the full text of every concept the view references. Without it the
 * assistant has a concept *mention* and a 76-character margin preview, and
 * fills the gap from its own memory of the subject instead of from the course.
 *
 * One rule decides what goes in: course content yes, reader content and
 * unattempted answers no. An answer the reader has not tried for is not put
 * where something else can hand it over, which is the property the quiz card
 * already has by only mounting its body after a reveal.
 *
 * Pure: it returns data. PageContext.jsx writes it into <head>.
