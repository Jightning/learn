 * src/lib/purge.js — erase one course's answers from this device
 *
 * Removing a course used to leave everything the reader had answered in it
 * behind, on the reasoning that learner state is keyed on the course code and
 * a re-add should restore it. That is a good property for *hiding* the bundled
 * guide, which is reversible by design. It is the wrong one for Remove: an
 * imported course is the only copy on the device, so "remove" is the reader
 * saying they are done with it, and orphaned state has no way of ever being
 * seen again — it is dead weight in a store that phones evict under pressure.
 *
 * So Remove now destroys, and this is the one place that knows what "destroy"
 * covers. It composes rather than reaches: every module keeps ownership of its
 * own key shape and exports the drop for it, because a purge that spelled the
 * keys out itself would silently miss the next one added.
 *
 *   Loop A ratings      state.drop        study:<code>
 *   Loop B schedule     retention.reset   retain:v1 → [cid]
 *   notes               notes.dropNotes   note:<cid>:*
 *   stated reasons      why.dropWhy       why:<cid>:*
 *   reading lane        tiers.dropLane    lane:<cid>
 *   reading depth       depth.dropDepth   depth:<cid>
 *   chosen accent       theme.dropHue     hue:<cid>
 *   replay checkpoint   replay.invalidate ckpt:<cid>
 *   outcome rows        log.dropCourse    the log itself
 *
 * The log goes last and matters most: everything above it is a fold over those
 * rows, so clearing the derived state alone would just refold it back on the
 * next load.
