/* ============================================================================
 * src/lib/search.js — ranked search over one course
 *
 * The previous version scanned every entry's whole text with `indexOf`, once
 * per query word, on every keystroke. On a 62-section course that is roughly a
 * megabyte of string scanning per character typed, and what it bought was a
 * ranking that could not tell a subsection which says "Laplace" forty times
 * from one that says it once: a hit scored 4 and its position scored at most
 * 3, and term frequency was never counted at all. A mention in the body was
 * therefore findable but effectively unranked.
 *
 * What replaces it is an inverted index — token to the documents holding it,
 * with a count — built once per course and queried in time proportional to how
 * rare the query is rather than how long the course is. Ranking is BM25, which
 * is what actually answers "how much does this entry have to say about this
 * word": it rewards repetition with diminishing returns, discounts words that
 * are everywhere, and normalises for length so a long subsection cannot win by
 * being long.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately *not* in the index:
 *
 *   - **Positions.** They are only needed to draw a snippet, and a snippet is
 *     only drawn for the two dozen entries that were going to be shown. Keeping
 *     them would multiply the index by the number of word occurrences in the
 *     course; finding them on demand costs one regex pass over 24 documents.
 *   - **A stemmer.** A course is a mix of English, symbols and notation, and a
 *     stemmer trained on none of it turns "series" into "seri". Prefix ranges
 *     over the sorted vocabulary do the same job with no dictionary: the query
 *     reaches every word it starts, and — via a shortened stem of its own —
 *     the words that start it, which is the "metastability finds metastable"
 *     case a prefix alone cannot reach.
