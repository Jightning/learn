/* Installing a course onto this device.
 *
 * A course is a folder of YAML — that is what a model writes when it follows
 * docs/create_course.md — so a folder is what this accepts. Re-importing the
 * same course replaces it, which is how an edit lands: hand the model the
 * folder, take back the changed folder, drop it here again. Answer history
 * survives, because learner state is keyed on the course code rather than on
 * the import.
 *
 * Nothing is uploaded. An installed course exists only in this browser, which
 * is why it can be private at all.
 *
 * This is the body of the library's Add dialog. Removing and exporting live on
 * the card of the course they act on (Library.jsx), where the object is in
 * front of the reader — a list of names under an install control made the
 * reader match a row to a card before they could act on it.
 *
 * What arrives is data from outside, so it is bounded before it is trusted. The
 * limits sit far above any real course — the largest here is 1.5MB
 * across 262 files — and far below anything that could wedge the tab.
