# Reference: feature map

Where each capability is shown, once.

## Block types

| type | shown in | notes |

| `ex` | §1.2, §2.2, §3.2 | fully stepped |

| `list` | §1.1, §1.5, §2.2 | ordered and unordered |

| `image` | §5.2 | with and without caption |
| `metric` | §3.1 | custom, from `blocks.js` |

## Figure kinds

`graph` (§4.1, circle + layered), `flow` (§4.1, row + col), `timing` (§4.1),
`plot` (§4.2, `fn` + `points` + `dash` + ranges), `bar` (§4.2, `baseline` +
`accent`), `scatter` (§4.2, `trend`), `grid` (§4.3, `index: binary` +

## Tiers

`spine` is the whole course, once. `depth` is why and what-if, never
examinable. `apply` is another instance. The Read selector under **Reading
options** in the sidebar offers Spine, Spine+Apply, All. Collapsed runs show a
stub with a text count. Read for the reader in §1.4, for the author in §3.2.

## Source badges

Real origin → plain badge. `unverified` → "not grounded in a named source"
(§5.2). `generated` → model-drafted, counts as unverified (§5.2). Blank →
not-yet-audited, counted separately.

## Course-level

`valueStyles`, `styles`, `syntax` (comment / keywords / patterns / strings),
`theme.hue`, `state.enabled`, `blocks.js`. A colour encoding is explained where
it is used, not on the start page: §1.4 teaches the tier vocabulary in the
material itself, where it can say what the words are for [T12].
