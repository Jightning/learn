/* ============================================================================
 * src/lib/place.js — where the reader is, kept across a reflow and a relaunch
 *
 * Two failures with one cause: a scroll offset is not a reading position.
 *
 *   - **Coming back to the app.** iOS discards a home-screen web app's view
 *     when the reader switches away, and relaunches it at the manifest's
 *     `start_url` — which carries no hash. A session three screens into §4
 *     came back to the library with nothing to say where it had been. The
 *     browser's own scroll restoration cannot help: the route is gone, so
 *     there is no document to restore a position within.
 *   - **Changing the width.** Rotating a phone, dragging a window narrower,
 *     tucking the sidebar or changing the content zoom re-wraps every line
 *     above the reader. The scroll offset is untouched and therefore points
 *     somewhere else — by a screen or more in a subsection that runs 2000px.
 *
 * Both are answered by storing an anchor rather than a number: *which*
 * subsection, and how far into it. That pair is invariant under a reflow that
 * changes every height above it, and it is small enough to write on every
 * pause in scrolling.
 *
 * The two failures want different anchors, and this is the one thing they do
 * not share. What is *written down* is the subsection: a relaunch re-renders
 * the route from data, and a block row only exists at the depth the reader was
 * last in, so a subsection is the finest id that is certain to be there. What
 * is held *across a reflow* is the block row, because the document is still the
 * same document and a subsection is too coarse to be worth pinning — see
 * `anchorAt`. `land` then re-applies as the layout finishes arriving, which is
 * what turns "the right row" into the right line.

 *
 * One scrollTo is not enough. A section is re-rendered from scratch and its

 * everything above the anchor grows, and the position computed on frame one is
 * 250-290px short by the time it stops. So the anchor's own position in the
 * document is watched, and the scroll is re-applied only when that number
 * actually moves — a settled anchor means the layout is done and the reader is
 * left alone.
 *
 * It also stops the moment the reader scrolls for themselves. Correcting a
 * page somebody has taken hold of is worse than landing a little short.
 *
 * Watching costs nothing; only moving the page does, and the rule below moves

 * reader a screen from the line they were on. That is the scroll this was
