/* What the structural gates cannot see: whether the content is true.
 *
 *   node tools/audit-content.mjs [course …]
 *
 * validate.mjs checks that references resolve, figures carry ids and equations
 * compile. It checks structure, never truth. A confident, well-formatted, wrong
 * account of amortised analysis fails no gate at all, and the reader cannot
 * tell, because everything else about the page has been verified to a high
 * standard.
 *
 * So every explanatory claim names where it came from, every worked answer
 * names the date it was re-derived, every question carries the specific prompt
 * the reader answers before the reveal, and every question names the concept a
 * confident miss should recruit. What is missing is counted as a fraction, and
 * a course fails above the ceiling it declares.
 *
 * The ceiling is per course, in `course.yaml`, and defaults to 1 — report
 * only — because these fractions are content debt that lands course by course:
 *
 *   audit:
 *     unsourced: 0.1     # fail if more than a tenth of claims name no source
 *     unverified: 0      # every answer carries a re-derivation date
 *
 * A course that has finished a pass declares the number it reached, and can
 * then never regress. A global ceiling could only ever be the worst course's.
