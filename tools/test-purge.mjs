/* Removing a course takes its answers with it — all of them, and only its own.
 *
 * The reader's history is spread over seven stores that each key on the course
 * differently: Loop A on the course *code*, Loop B under a shared `retain:v1`
 * blob, notes and reasons as families of prefixed keys, the lane and the replay
 * checkpoint as single keys, and the outcome log as rows. A purge that misses
 * one is worse than no purge at all: the checkpoint alone would refold the log
 * straight back on the next load, and a stale Loop A row would resurface under
 * a different course that happens to share a code.
 *
 * So the assertions are two-sided. Everything about the removed course is gone,
 * and everything about the course beside it is untouched — the second half is
 * the one that catches a prefix sweep written slightly too wide.
