/* Duplicate-selector lint.
 *
 * Three defects in this project came from the same shape: a correction
 * appended to the bottom of a stylesheet, redeclaring a selector already
 * defined above it. The later rule silently wins, the earlier one becomes
 * dead, and nothing says so — a sticky sidebar turned relative, a figure's
 * number lost its centring, a rail number only took its layout on hover.
 *
 * A selector may legitimately appear twice inside different @media blocks, so
 * only top-level rules are compared, and only within one file. T22 says a
 * stylesheet covers one UI element; T25 says a rule that can be checked
 * mechanically must be.
 *
 * The second shape is the mirror of the first: a rule that silently loses. A
 * var() naming a token nothing declares makes its declaration invalid at
 * computed-value time, and the browser drops it whole — the rest of the
 * shorthand with it. Five were live at once in the library and sync panels:
 * `var(--serif)` voided two `font` shorthands, so 14px captions rendered at
 * 17px, and `var(--accent)` voided an `outline`, so a focus ring disappeared.
 *
 * A fallback does not rescue it, it hides it: `var(--warn, #b91c1c)` painted a
 * hardcoded red that tracks no theme and measured 2.87:1 on the dark ground,
 * the one AA failure in the sweep. So a missing token is reported whether or
 * not a fallback stands behind it — under T3 the fallback is itself the defect.
 *
 * The third shape is a rule that was never written. A class the engine emits
 * with no rule behind it renders as unstyled markup and reports nothing at
 * all: `syntax:` had been a documented course field for as long as the
 * highlighter existed, and every `tok-c`/`tok-k`/`tok-n`/`tok-s` span it
 * produced was flat body text; a table's `split:` marked a column and drew no
 * rule; the one text box in the primer sat at the browser default inside a
 * designed card. Each looked like a course that had not configured the
 * feature.
 *
 * Nothing reported any of this on its own: the CSS parses, the token is simply
 * never there, and the missing rule is simply never written.
